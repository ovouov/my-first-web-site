<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.
    He conceived it as an information management system using several concepts and technologies,
    the most fundamental of which was the connections that existed between information.[8][9][10]
    The first proposal was written in 1989,[7] and a working system implemented by the end of 1990 including the WorldWideWeb browser and an HTTP server.
    [11]The technology was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991,
    and then to the general public on 23 August 1991</p>
